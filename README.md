# Simutron

A game that I am making.

## Current activity

Working on getting a 2d tile system set up, as well as timed city updates.

Thinking about writing a manual, but the game is so simple...

## Installation

Simutron can be built using Scons or Code::Blocks.  Feel free to add other
build systems, but please ignore any extra files that they create.

## Documentation

Documentation can be produced using doxygen
